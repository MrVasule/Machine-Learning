# Machine Learning 
Macine learning is brach of computer science. ML technique gives computer a ability to learn without being explicity programmed.

## Aim - 
    Minimze the Error or Loss in our data.

## Objective - 
    1- Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.
    2- Accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts.
    3- Built on NumPy, SciPy, Seaborn, and matplotlib.
    4- Open source, commercially usable.
    
## Types - 
### a - Supervised Learning
### b - Unsupervised Learning

## Supervised Learning -  
Supervised learning is an approach to creating artificial intelligence (AI), where a computer algorithm is trained on input data that has been labeled for a particular output.
## Aim - 
    Predict the correct label for unseen data.
During Traning - SL algorithm searches for pattern that corelate with the desired output.

After  Traning - Take in unseen input and determine which label to classify it to.

## Types - 
  ## Regression 
  ## Classsification 

## Regression - 
Find relationship between dependend and independent variable.

Goal - To predict continues values such as test score.

## Type - 
1 - Linear Regression 

2 - Support Vector Machine

3 - Decision Tree 

4 - Multiple Linear Regression

5 - Polynomial Regression

6 - Logistic Regression

7 - Random Forest 

8 -  K Nearest Neighbour
